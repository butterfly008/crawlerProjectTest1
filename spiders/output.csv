" Pioneer Natural Resources, which once promised production to rival Libya, was part of a revolution that helped make the U.S. a global oil player. Now after years of overspending, the company is pulling back."
" Bristol-Myers Squibb said it would divest itself of Otezla, a psoriasis treatment owned by Celgene, to help smooth the path for the companies’ pending merger."
